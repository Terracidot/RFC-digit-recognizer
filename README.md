# RFC machine learning model
### Random Forest Classifier machine learning model designed to analise and predict single digits.
### Hyper Parameter Tuning:
### Sigmoid is used in the output layer while making binary predictions.
### Softmax is used in the output layer while making multi-class predictions.
### A good default for batch size might be 16, 32, 64, 128 and so on.
### PLEASE NOTE! This code is quite old (2020) and is complicated. As such I won't be including any extensive notes on how it works.
